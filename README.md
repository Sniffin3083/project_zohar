# Project Zohar
This is a project that will allow players of certain JRPG games to track their progress in their games. Starting with the games in the Xenoblade Chronicles francise. This app will allow players to check off everything they have done in a game as well as give them a interactive map to find everything that they need. An app like this will help players get that lofty 100% completion goal that they so desire in games like this.

## Example
Using Xenoblade Chronicles 3 as the example, there are many quests in which the player can undertake from main story quests, to side quests, to what the game calls "Hero Quests". This app will give the plays access to iteractive maps to find all of these quests but also allow them to check it off on a checklist to help them keep track of what they have completed. And if they require the app will also give an incomprehensive guide on how to complete said quests. This is just an example of what this will do, the interactive map will also help players find useful items in the world to help them on their quests.

## Why "Project Zohar"
I am calling this app "Project Zohar" as a temporary name since the first releases of will be focused on the games featured in the Xenoblade Chronicles franchise. In this franchise there is an object called "The Conduit" which its design is heavily based off an object called "The Zohar" from the Xenosaga franchise. Since the Xenoblade Chronicles franchise is a spiritual successor to the Xenosaga franchise I thought it would be fitting to name this project after the object that inspired the design of the object that is the focus of the Xenoblade Chronicles franchise.

## How to use
Currently the app is in extremely early development and is not ready for use. Once it is ready for use I will update this section with instructions on how to use the app.
